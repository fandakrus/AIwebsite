                        concise versions, which can be useful for busy professionals or students who need to quickly
                        understand the main points of a document.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Dialogue Generation: I can generate human-like dialogue in various scenarios, this can be used
                        for virtual assistants, chatbots and even movies scripts.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Code Generation: I can assist developers by writing code based on a set of instructions. This can
                        save time and improve efficiency for development teams.</p>
                </li>
